GitHub account names are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and are intended for immediate and active use.

#### Name Squatting Policy

GitHub prohibits account name squatting, and account names may not be inactively held for future use. Inactive accounts may be renamed or removed by GitHub staff at their discretion. Keep in mind that not all activity on GitHub is publicly visible. Staff will not remove or rename any active account.

Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for account names are prohibited and may result in permanent account suspension.

#### Requesting a Username

If you would like to request the account name of someone you believe is violating GitHubâ€™s name squatting policy, please follow the steps in the [Changing your GitHub username](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-your-github-username) article before contacting Support. Following these steps will help you determine if the desired account name is available for release and guide you towards contacting Support, where applicable.

#### Trademark Policy

If you believe someone's account is violating your trademark rights, you can find more information about making a trademark complaint on our [Trademark Policy](/articles/github-trademark-policy/) page.
